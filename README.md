# Kingdom-Animalia-
Week 5 Task @GenesysTechHub, given by Ezeh Livinus 
This project was carried out to demostrate the four principles of Object-Oriented Programming in Javascript.

Here is a brief explanation of how the principles of OOP were applied in the code kingdom Animalia.

1. Inheritance: The Invertebrate, Arthropod, Vertebrate, and other animal classes all inherit properties and methods from the base Animal class. For example, the Arthropod class inherits the warmBlooded and coldBlooded properties from the Animal class, as well as any other properties or methods that may be defined in the Animal class.

2. Polymorphism: The warm-blooded and cold-blooded properties have different values for each type of animal, even though they are defined in the same way in the base Animal class. For example, the value of warmBlooded is true for aves and mammals, and false for all other animals.

3. Encapsulation: The warmBlooded and coldBlooded properties are private to each animal instance, and can only be accessed using the appropriate methods. For example, you could define a method in the Animal class that returns the value of the warmBlooded property, but you would not be able to directly access the property from outside the class.

4. Abstraction: The Animal class abstracts the concept of an animal, and the various subclasses provide more specific details about different types of animals. For example, the Vertebrate class represents the general concept of a vertebrate, while the Fish, Amphibian, and other subclasses provide more specific details about different types of vertebrates.

I hope this helps to clarify how the four principles of OOP are applied in the code!

Thanks Mr. Ezeh Livinus for making clear these wonderful concepts.
